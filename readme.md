Eclipse Mita is a new programming language for the embedded IoT.
It targets developers who are new to embedded software development, specifically those who come from a cloud background.
As a developer Mita feels like a modern programming language (in the vein of TypeScript), but translates to C code which compiles to native code running directly on the embedded hardware.
Combining declarative configuration, powerful language features with code generation enables projects to scale their deployment over quantity - from the first prototype to shipping thousands of devices.

## Getting started
At the moment Mita is meant to be integrated into the development environments of device vendors.
For example, the [Bosch Cross Domain Development Kit (XDK110)](http://xdk.io) ships Mita in its workbench under the name of _XDK LIVE_.

To get an impression of how Mita looks like, check out a [short quick demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv68Yc3u7i4), or a talk from the [Eclipse IoT Day 2018 in Grenoble](https://gricad.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/video/eclipse-pax-new-programming-language-embedded-iot).

## Using Mita
Please take a look at the Mita documentation which provides examples, a getting started guide and a language reference.
