 * Similar to C pointers, but: 
 * - You can always read contents of references
 * - You can never return anything with references
 * - You can always pass references to another function
 * - You can always reference value types
 * - You can always modify values that are referenced (that is the base values that are referenced)
 * - You can only set referenced references if the new reference belongs to the same person or it's ancestor as the original one (too hard --> forbidden)
 * - You can do whatever you want to (contents of) values that you didn't get by reference
