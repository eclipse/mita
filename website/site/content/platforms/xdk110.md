## Overview: The XDK110

The Bosch Cross Domain Development Kit (XDK) is a programmable sensor device for building IoT applications.
It contains a wide range of sensors and means of connectivity and is extensible using its extension bus.
Due to its versatility it also serves as reference platform for Mita.

To learn more about the XDK head over to [http://xdk.io](http://xdk.io).

### Implemented System Resources

Currently implemented sensors, connectivities and buses in the XDK110 platform:

For the gyroscope you can choose from three different variants:

1. Pre-calibrated, more robust through sensor fusion
2. Direct access to BMI160
3. Direct access to BMG160

## Configuration

### Binary Name

To customize the produced binary name configure `XDK110.applicationName: string` . The default name is `MitaApplication`:

```TypeScript
setup XDK110 {
  applicationName = "ShockDetector";
}
```

### Startup Delay

To debug the startup process you can configure a startup delay so the XDK can connect via USB before setting up devices, connectivity, etc.:

```TypeScript
setup XDK110 {
  startupDelay = 5000; /* wait 5 seconds before initialization */
}
```

### Extension Bus Power

Per default the XDK doesn't power the 2.5V and 3.3V lines on its extension bus. Some system resources like I2C or GPIO already change this, however in some cases you need to do this manually for example when using the ADC with a microphone:

```TypeScript
setup XDK110 {
  powerExternalDevices = true;
}
```

### Sensors

Any sensor can be used without configuring it. It will be initialized with sensible defaults. If you want to change a sensor's default hardware parameters just set it up, e.g. the accelerometer:

```TypeScript
setup accelerometer {
  // change the bandwidth of the low-pass filter
  bandwidth = BW_1000Hz;
}
```

Content assist (`CTRL+Space`) will provide you with all available configuration items and their valid values.

Temperature, pressure and humidity are available from a single resource: `environment`.

## Device Information

The XDK offers some information you can read out via modalities. 

### Power Status

An approximation of whether the device is charging or on battery, and what the battery level is can be read out using `XDK110.powerStatus`. For example:

```TypeScript
every button_one.pressed {
    let ps = XDK110.powerStatus.read();
    where(ps) {
        is(PowerStatus.Battery -> level) {
            println(`Battery level: approx. ${level}%`);
        }
        is(PowerStatus.Corded) {
            println("Charged");
        }
    }   
}
```

This is only an approximation based on the voltage level read out of channel 7. During charging the reported level can be over 100%.

### Connectivities

#### Hardware

Hardware connectivities are available as named singletons: this means that you can configure each connectivity only once and need to give it a name. These connectivities however offer multiple instantiation of their signals. This means that for example the LED resource can provide up to three different signals for the yellow, orange and red LED.

#### Software

Software connectivities can have as many instances as you want. Both HTTP REST and MQTT require you to specify a WLAN instance as a transport layer.

### Buses

#### GPIO

GPIO is a named singleton: you can instantiate it once and need to give it a name. Each of the 21 available GPIO pins can be configured as either input or output. Input pins can be operated in different modes:

* pull up/pull down: the pin is connected to high or low via a resistor, so that if the pin is not driven from the outside it returns to a set state.
* pull up with glitch filter: like pull up except for small glitches being filtered out.
* no pull: the pin floats freely, i.e. if it is not driven it keeps its current state except for environmental influences and self-drain.

#### I2C

I2C can be instantiated multiple times so you can model different devices on the same bus. You can exchange either single words from one to four byte or complete messages as arrays of integer words. For multi-byte words, both little and big endianess are supported with the default being the XDK's endianess, little endian.

### Events

Some sensors provide events you can react to. These events are things like "device moved" (`accelerometer.any_motion`) or "button was pressed" (`button_one`/`button_two.pressed`).

The platform itself provides a special `startup` event which is triggered after the device has fully started up. This means that all resources are initialized, for example WLAN is connected, sensors collect data, and all events are enabled.

# Specification

## Sensors

### Accelerometer (BMA280)
The BMA280 is a tri axial, low-g acceleration sensor with digital output for consumer applications. It allows measurements of acceleration in three perpendicular axes.

--------------------------------|------------
`any_motion`                    | The any motion event (also called activity) uses the change between two successive acceleration measurements to detect changes in motion. An event is generated when this change exceeds the any_motion_threshold.
`no_motion`                     | The no motion event (also called any inactivity) uses the change between two successive acceleration measurements to detect changes in motion. An event is generated when this change consecutively stays below the no_motion_threshold.
`low_g`                         | The low g event is based on comparing acceleration to a threshold which is most useful for free-fall detection.
`high_g`                        | The high g event is based on comparing acceleration to a threshold to detect shocks or other high acceleration events.
`single_tap`                    | A single tap is an event triggered by high activity followed shortly by no activity.
`double_tap`                    | A double tap consists of two single tap events right after one another.
`flat`                          | The flat event is triggered when the device is flat on the ground.
`orientation`                   |
`fifo_full`                     |
`fifo_wml`                      |
`new_data`                      | This event serves the asynchronous reading of data. It is generated after storing a new value of z-axis acceleration data in the data register.

### Light(MAX44009)
The XDK light sensor.

#### Configuration

   | Name                            | Description
---|---------------------------------|------------
   | `manual_mode: bool`                           | Enables the manual configuration of integration time and high brightness mode. If set to `false` (default) the chip automatically selects those values. Default: `false`.
   | `integration_time: MAX44009_IntegrationTime`  | The integration time is the time the sensor collects light for. In automatic mode (manual mode set to `false`) the chip automatically selects the integration time. Default: 800ms.
   | `high_brightness: bool`                       | Set to `true` so that only 1/8 of the photo diode current goes to the ADC. This mode is used in high-brightness situations to avoid saturation/clipping effects of the ADC. Default: `false`.
   | `continuous_mode: bool`                       | In default mode (`false`) the IC measures lux intensity only once every 800ms regardless of integration time. This mode allows the part to operate at its lowest possible supply current. <br><br> In continuous mode (`true`) the IC continuously measures lux intensity. That is, as soon as one reading is finished, a new one begins. If integration time is 6.25ms, readings are taken every 6.25ms. If integration time is 800ms, readings are taken every 800ms. In this mode, the part consumes slightly higher power than in the default mode. Default: `false`.

--------------------------------|---------------------------------------
`intensity: uint32`             | The light intensity of the MAX44009.

### Noise Sensor

The noise sensor uses the XDK's microphone to detect noise around it. The noise is calculated over 256 microphone samples. Note that this value is without unit and needs to be calibrated/converted by your application if you require absolute noise level measurements.

#### Configuration

   | Name                            | Description
---|---------------------------------|------------
   | `samplingFrequency: uint32`     | How often the microphone is sampled in Hertz. Default: `2560Hz`.
   | `timeout: uint32`               | If not enough samples are ready how long to wait for additional samples in milliseconds. Default: `100ms`.

#### Modalities

Name                            | Description
--------------------------------|---------------------------------------
`noise: float`                  | An uncalibrated noise level. Should not enough samples be ready when getting this modality even after waiting `timeout` milliseconds this will throw an exception.

### Buttons

The XDK features two buttons. Pressed and released are encoded by `true` and `false` in Mita. Button presses can be detected using event handlers, i.e. `every button_one.pressed`.

`light_up: bool`                | Represents one of the three LEDs.     | `color: LedColor`  | One of `Yellow`, `Orange` or `Red`.

### ADC

The XDK's ADC (Analog Digital Converter) can measure voltages against internal or external potentials.

#### Configuration

   | Name                                | Description
---|-------------------------------------|------------
   | `externalReferenceVoltage: uint16`  | The reference voltage to measure against when you use an external reference voltage in a signal in [mV].

#### Signals

Name                            | Description                           | Parameters |

### BLE

BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) allows the XDK to communicate over short range, up to 50m, with various devices like smartphones. In BLE a server continuously advertises all characteristics and clients can connect without requiring further interaction or authentication.

#### Configuration

   | Name                            | Description
---|---------------------------------|------------
   | `deviceName: string`            | The name of the device as advertised via GAP.
   | `macAddress: string`            | MAC address of the device. Must start with `FC-D6-BD`. You may use either colon `:` or dash `-` as byte separators.
   | `serviceUID: uint32`            | The last four bytes of the UUID of the GATT service we'll create.
   | `advertisingInterval: int16`    | The GAP advertisement interval. Default: `1000`.

`int32_characteristic(): int32`    | A signed integer GATT characteristic.    | `UUID: uint32`  | The last four bytes of the characteristic UUID. Defaults to the hash code of the VCI name.


### WLAN

WLAN is one of the hardware connectivities available on the XDK. Configuration is done using [sum types]({{< ref "/language/types.md#sum-tymes" >}}). Even though the concept of sum types may be daunting they are actually very easy to use.
Say you want to configure `authentication`. Content assist (`CTRL+Space`) offers you three different choices: `None`, `Enterprise` and `Personal`. Each accepts a different number of parameters. For example to configure a WLAN with WPA2 Personal you would write this:

```TypeScript
setup net: WLAN {
  ssid = "MyWlan";
  authentication = Personal(psk = "mySecretKey");
  /* ... */
}
```

Configuring IP address works the same: you can choose from either `Dhcp` or `Static`.

Content assist will help you fill in all parameters.

#### Configuration

   | Name                            | Description
---|---------------------------------|------------
**Required** | `authentication: Authentication`      | How to authenticate to the WLAN network.
**Required** | `ssid: string`                        | The SSID of the WLAN network we want to connect to.
   | `isHostPgmEnabled: bool`                        | If true, server certificate will be uploaded to the WLAN chip CC3100. Make sure to update service pack of the WLAN and then upload the certificate. Certificate must placed under `XDK110/common/certs/XDKDummy`. Default: `false`.
   | `ipConfiguration: IpConfiguration`              | How to configure IP address. Default: `Dhcp()`.


### MQTT

MQTT is a messaging protocol for low bandwidth networks. The current implementation is based on the serval stack. MQTT requires a setup WLAN resource.

#### Example

```TypeScript
setup net: WLAN { /* ... */ }

setup backend: MQTT {
  transport = net;
  url = "mqtt://iot.eclipse.org";
  clientId = "XDK42";

  var telemetry = topic("telemetry");
}

every 100 milliseconds {
  backend.telemetry.write(`${accelerometer.magnitude.read()}`);
}
```

#### Configuration

   | Name                                 | Description
---|--------------------------------------|------------
**Required** | `transport: WLAN`          | The transport layer used for communication.
**Required** | `url: string`              | The URL pointing to the MQTT broker, for example: `mqtt://does-not.exist:1883`. You can use MQTT with TLS by specifying the protocol `mqtts://` instead of `mqtt://`. Doing so requires you to specify the expected server certificate with `certificatePath`.
**Required** | `clientId: string`         | A unique name the broker can use to identify devices. No two clients may have the same name per broker.
   | `authentication: MqttAuthentication` | Username/Password authentication or unauthenticated, for example `authentication = Login("user", "pass")`. Default: `None()`.
   | `lastWill: MqttWill`                 | The last will that will be published on a forceful disconnect. Either `NoWill()` or `LastWill(topic="topic", message="message", qos=1)`. Default: `NoWill()`.
   | `cleanSession: bool`                 | The clean session flag indicates to the broker whether the client wants to establish a clean session or a persistent session where all subscriptions and messages (QoS 1 & 2) are stored for the client. Default: `false`.
   | `keepAliveInterval: uint32`          | The keep alive interval (in seconds) is the time the client commits to for when sending regular pings to the broker. The broker responds to the pings enabling both sides to determine if the other one is still alive and reachable. Creates an automatic ping task that pings twice in this interval. Default: `60`.
   | `certificatePath: string`            | The path to the expected server certificate used for MQTT with TLS.

In the latter case this will look for the certificate relative to the project root. The certificate needs to be in PEM format (`-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`/`-----END CERTIFICATE-----`). **This configuration item is required when using MQTT over TLS.**

### Eclipse Hono

Mita implements a `HonoMqtt` resource you can use to easily connect to an [Eclipse Hono](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/) service via MQTT.

#### Example

```TypeScript
setup net: WLAN { /* ... */ }

setup backend: HonoMqtt {
  transport = net;
  url = "mqtt://iot.eclipse.org";
  clientId = "XDK42";
  authentication = Authenticated(username="consumer@HONO", password="verysecret");

  var telemetry = telemetry(qos=0);
}

every 100 milliseconds {
  backend.telemetry.write(`${accelerometer.magnitude.read()}`);
}
```

### REST over HTTP

Using REST you can easily talk to servers over HTTP. REST defines a stateless interface with a simple URL scheme. Normally a REST server consists of a versioned endpoint like `http://api.github.com/v3` which then provides different resources, for example `api.github.com/v3/repos/eclipse/mita/branches` and `/repos/eclipse/mita/issues`.

Currently only writing is supported.

#### Example

```TypeScript
setup net: WLAN { /* ... */ }

setup backend: HttpRestClient {
  transport = net;
  endpointBase = "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com";

  var posts = resource("/posts");
}

every 100 milliseconds {
  backend.branches.write(`${accelerometer.magnitude.read()}`);
}
```

#### Configuration

   | Name                            | Description
---|---------------------------------|------------
**Required** |`transport: WLAN`       | The transport layer used for communication.
**Required** |`endpointBase: string`  | The server URL base to which REST requests are made.
   | `headerContent: string`          | A custom header which is added to each HTTP request. Example: `"X-Auth: MySecretToken\nX-Version: 1.0"`.

 || `readMethod: HttpMethod`   | Which method to use when reading. Default: `GET`

### LoRa

LoRa is a low-power network for IoT. Since bandwidth is usually extremely limited you should only send small messages infrequently. 
In this implementation there are two ways to send data: either raw bytes or [CayenneLPP](https://mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload) messages, a serializable predefined format.

Receiving messages is currently not supported.

### Example

```TypeScript
setup lora: LoRa {
  region = EU;
  loraAppKey = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0];
  loraAppEui = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0];

  var r = raw(0, Unconfirmed);
  var c = cayenne(1, Confirmed);
}

every 1 hour {
  let data = new array<CayennePayload>(1);
  data[0] = CayennePayload.Accelerometer(
    accelerometer.x_axis.read() as int16, 
    accelerometer.y_axis.read() as int16, 
    accelerometer.z_axis.read() as int16
  );
  lora.c.write(data);
}

every 10 minutes {
  let data: array<uint8> = [0xCA, 0xFE];
  lora.r.write(data);
}
```

#### Configuration

   | `loraDeviceEui: array<uint8>`        | Optionally set the device's EUI. If you don't set this the predefined EUI of your LoRa board will be used.
   | `adaptiveDataRate: bool`             | Control whether adaptive data rate is turned on. Default: `true`.
   | `bandFrequency: uint16`              | Configure the band frequency according to your gateway **in MHz**. Valid values are for the EU module: 433 MHz and 868 MHz, and for the US module 915 MHz. Defaults: EU: 868, US: 915

   | `rx2DataRate: uint8`                 | Configure the Rx2 data rate according to your gateway. Valid values are for the EU module: 0 to 7, and for the US module: 8 to 13. Defaults: EU: 0, US: 8
   | `dataRate: uint8`                    | Configure the data rate according to your gateway. Valid values are for the EU module: 0 to 7, and for the US module: 0 to 4. Default: 3

 || `confirmation: LoRaMessageConfirmation`   | Whether to send confirmed messages. One of `Confirmed` and `Unconfirmed`. Default: `Unconfirmed`

#### Cayenne Messages
The following CayenneLPP messages are supported via a [sum type]({{< ref "/language/types.md#sum-tymes" >}}):

```
alt CayennePayload {
    DigitalInput: uint8
  | DigitalOutput: uint8
  | AnalogInput: int16
  | AnalogOutput: int16
  | IlluminanceSensor: uint16
  | PresenceSensor: uint8
  | TemperatureSensor: int16
  | HumiditySensor: uint8
  | Accelerometer: int16, int16, int16
  | Barometer: uint16
  | Gyrometer: int16, int16, int16
  | GpsLocation: {Latitude: int32, Longitude: int32, Altitude: int32}
}
```

Constructing them works like in the example above or as described in the documentation of [sum types]({{< ref "/language/types.md#sum-tymes" >}}). 
For example to create a GPS location message type `CayennePayload.GpsLocation(Latitude=lat, Altitude=alt, Longitude=lon)`.

## Buses

### GPIO

GPIO provides bit-wise communication with the environment. Low (0V) and high (3.3V) are represented by `false` and `true`.

#### Example

```TypeScript
setup test: GPIO {
  var out = digitalOut(pin = PA1, initialValue = false);
  var inp = digitalIn(pin = PB2, mode = PullDown);
}

every 100 milliseconds {
  test.out.write(true);
  let x = test.inp.read();
}
```

## IO

### SD Card

SD cards can be used to log data without connectivity. Only FAT32 is supported.

There are different kinds of file access:

- read or write
- resuming/appending or rewinding
- text or binary

Resuming only applies to read access to files. It means that, when you do consecutive reads, the second reads picks up where the first left of.

Appending only applies to write access to files. It means that, when you write to an already existing file, you will always append content.

Rewinding applies to both kinds of accesses to files. It means that reads or writes always start at the beginning of the file. When writing, the file will always be truncated first.

Text means you will get null terminated strings, where binary will give you blocks of bytes.

In all cases, writing will ensure that the file exists and create it if it doesn't.

You can declare multiple files with the same path; this way you can read and write at the same time or emulate pipes.

Files will not stay open between calls, this means that you can safely declare a file with write access multiple times, for example to read it in both text- and binary-mode.
